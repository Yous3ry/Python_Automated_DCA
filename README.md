# Python Automatic Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) For Petroleum Producing wells

## About The Project
Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) is a widely accepted method for analyzing declining production rates and forecasting future performance of oil and gas wells. [[1]](#1) For oil fields with hundreds or even thousands of wells updating the production forecast for each well based on DCA could be very time consuimg. Here's why:_
1. Typically curve fitting to estimate the decline rate and initial rate is done graphically which could be very time consuming.
2. Multiple forecasts could be requested with different cut-off economic rates per well or different.
3. Over the life of a conventional oil producing well, decline rates may change over time with changes in operating conditions, e.g. start of water injection, aritifical lift methodlogy or effciency changes, etc. Thus the history of the well could be divided into different distinct regions and DCA parameters should only be estimated based on the last stable producing conditions rather than average fitting of all the historical performance.
