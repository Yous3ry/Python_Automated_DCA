# Python Automatic Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) For Petroleum Producing wells

## About The Project
Decline Curve Analysis (DCA) is a widely accepted method for analyzing declining production rates and forecasting future performance of oil and gas wells. [[1]](#1) For oil fields with hundreds or even thousands of wells updating the production forecast for each well based on DCA could be very time consuimg. Here's why:
1. 
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
